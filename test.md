*“Æthiopia produces dragons, not so large as those of India, but still, twenty cubits in length.1 The only thing that surprises me is, how Juba came to believe that they have crests.2 The Æthiopians are known as the Asachæi, among whom they most abound; and we are told, that on those coasts four or five of them are found twisted and interlaced together like so many osiers in a hurdle, and thus setting sail, with their heads erect, they are borne along upon the waves, to find better sources of nourishment in Arabia.”*

*“Æthiopia produces the lynx1 in abundance, and the sphinx, which has brown hair and two mammæ on the breast,2 as well as many monstrous kinds of a similar nature; horses with wings, and armed with horns, which are called pegasi;3 the crocotta, an animal which looks as though it had been produced by the union of the wolf and the dog,4 for it can break any thing with its teeth, and instantly on swallowing it digest it with the stomach; monkeys, too, with black heads, the hair of the ass, and a voice quite unlike that of any other animal.5"*

### Catoblepas

*“Among the Hesperian Æthiopians is the fountain of Nigris, by many, supposed to be the head of the Nile. I have already mentioned the arguments by which this opinion is supported.1 Near this fountain, there is found a wild beast, which is called the catoblepas;2 an animal of moderate size, and in other respects sluggish in the movement of the rest of its limbs; its head is remarkably heavy, and it only carries it with the greatest difficulty, being always bent down towards the earth. Were it not for this circumstance, it would prove the destruction of the human race; for all who behold its eyes, fall dead upon the spot.”*
